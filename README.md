Task 1: On task 1, I decided to analyse two travel website that align to my purpose ideas. There are Airbnb and Traveloka.

Airbnb manages to get everything right in their elegantly designed website. My favourite part of their responsive design approach was seeing the way their navigation bars change when switching from desktop to mobile devices. On a mobile device, the menus compact themselves into a single search bar where the different pages can be accessed easily

On the other hand, Traveloka website is not a responsive website because the texts and elements doesn’t merge into the screen size when user adjust the screen. When user click Traveloka’s link on website, it directly brings user to download the app instead of viewing from the website.

Task 2: In task 2, I did refinement on my week 1 practical task one to three. I improved my web page with considering the page layout, add horizontal navigation bar, and I change the colour and graphics elements. I also make sure to make my page responsive.

Task 3: User stories are used to sharing knowledge of a user's goals, objectives, and the value they derive from a particular product, service or capability. After defined user stories, I use Figma to design how the user interface will looks like.

After defined user stories, I sketched out my idea based on the user stories on Figma. When starting Figma for the first time I have the impression that I’m using a web-based version of sketch.

Task 4: To improve my web page, I added my portfolio webiste by using iframe and API's location. The advantage of having iframe on HTML page is, Iframe can display the embedded web page intact.
