Task 1: On task 1, I decided to analyse two travel website that align to my purpose ideas. There are Airbnb and Traveloka.

Airbnb manages to get everything right in their elegantly designed website. My favourite part of their responsive design approach was seeing the way their navigation bars change when switching from desktop to mobile devices. On a mobile device, the menus compact themselves into a single search bar where the different pages can be accessed easily
